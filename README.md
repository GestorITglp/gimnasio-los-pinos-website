# Gimnasio los Pinos website

This is the repo for storing all of the source code for the Gimnasio los Pinos
website.

## Hosting setup

The project was originally deployed to Vercel. Keep in mind that the project
was moved out from Vercel because in Vercel, once your website has more than
2500 views monthly you have to pay $20 a month.

Since the Gimnasio los pinos has already a plan with Colombia Hosting, the
project is now deployed with them, on a VPS. In order to understand how the Next.js
was deployed to a Colombia Hosting VPS, see this article. Keep in mind that the
article is explaining the step by step process on a Ubuntu VPS. The VPS that we
have is an Alma Linux VPS.
