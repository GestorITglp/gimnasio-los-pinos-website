# Gimnasio los Pinos website

This is the repo for storing all of the source code for the Gimnasio los Pinos
website.

## Hosting setup

The project was originally deployed to Vercel. Keep in mind that the project
was moved out from Vercel because in Vercel, once your website has more than
2500 views monthly you have to pay $20 a month.

Since the Gimnasio los pinos has already a plan with Hosting Colombia, the
project is now deployed with them, on a VPS.

## Running the project

### On localhost

- Clone the project from GitHub and store it somewhere on your computer
- Go to the location where you have stored the project and run `npm run dev`
- After running the command a window will open on your default browser with the
  project running.

### Live

- Go to www.gimnasiolospinos.co
